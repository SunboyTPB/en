            <h3>Website Administrator, Light Novel Writer</h3>
            <br />
            <p>Yeah, I am SunboyTPB that writing light novel, and the administrator of this website.</p>
            <p>I'm very happy every day.</p>
            <p>The reason that the nickname is TPB, because I am the bright boy, and I want to travel around the world. So T means "Travel" or "Traveller", and B means "Bright" or "Bright Boy". Guess why I choose the picture of Aether(Traveller in Genshin Impact).</p>
            <p>And, there is only me alone...... ┭┮﹏┭┮ ......hope you can join us(me).</p>
